# CS152A-Lab4-TicTacToe

## Layout of Files

1. VGA folder contains VGA related code 

- clock divider
- the demo for the display - we will probably modify this later to act as the main Tic-Tac-Toe module
- vga640x480 which includes code we are modifying).

## Plan of Attack

1. Work on stuff unrelated to display outside of class (draft ideas on how we could do display) - general TicTacToe board (First), AI, basic game/ timing

2.  Work on display stuff during class
